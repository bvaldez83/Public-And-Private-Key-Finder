# Public Key Encryptor
This is currently a work in progress public key encryption app.
Here's a screenshot of what the program can do so far:

This program was inspired by a handout from my Introduction to Information Security course. In class we covered how to manually find the private key and so I'm interested in implementing it via a computer program. So far the program can complete steps 1 through 3 but I'm encountering a little difficulty with step 4. 

## Update
I was able to complete step 4 through utilizing the instructions on the [Sciencing Website](https://sciencing.com/calculate-coprime-6921150.html). While jamming to some [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AftvCIiYk5c), and searching Stack Overflow for a message from the Gods, I realized that it's possible to just iterate through the ArrayList! Through doing this I successfully solved my months old issue.
 
Below is a screenshot of the handout:
