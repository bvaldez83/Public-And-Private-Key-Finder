# Public & Private Key Finder
__Inspiration for Program__

This program was inspired by a handout from my Introduction to Information Security course. In class we covered how to manually find the public and private key and so I'm interested in implementing it via a computer program. Through accepting user input (2 prime numbers, p and q, and a relative coprime number) the app is able to find the public key and calculate the private key's private decrypt exponent.

Here's a screenshot of the program finding both the public and private keys when p = 5, q = 11 and the coprime is 7:
